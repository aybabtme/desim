Focus on your model, `desim` handles the rest.

## about

`desim` is a framework that allows one to quickly produce programs that implement a simulation. `desim` takes care of scheduling events in a simulation, distributing jobs in a cluster and gathering results.

`desim` can also be used as a simple package for one off simulations, or if you want to take care of the operations by yourself.
